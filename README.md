# Welcome to 17AMBBLS !

Hi! I am sharing my lab notes from the course **17AMBBLS - Biological Signals Processing** for which I was Lab Tutor during Spring 2010-2014.

Please refer to [this page](https://predmety.fbmi.cvut.cz/en/17ambbls) if you want to visit the official course page at the Czech Technical University.

# Syllabus

Each Lab focussed on a biological signal. We first recall the physiology behind the signal before having a closer look at its structure and features. We then use the BIOPAC MP35 Data Acquisition equipment to record live signals. 

Preliminary signal analysis is made in the BIOPAC AcqKnowledge software. Advanced signal processing is conducted using Matlab.

* Lab1: Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Heart rate variability (HVR)
* Lab3: Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)
* Lab4: Photoplethysmography signal (PPG)
* Lab5: Respiration signal (Resp)
* Lab6: Electromyogram (EMG)
* Lab7: Electroencephalogram (EEG)
* Lab8: Electrooculography signal (EOG)
* Lab11: Heart rate variability with Fast Fourier Transform in Matlab
* Lab12: Heart rate variability with Wavelet Transform in Matlab

The final team projects:

* Project1: Cardiovascular Signal Analyzer

	Digital filtering of a raw PPG signal
	
	Extraction of PH (pulse height) and PP (peak to peak) values from a filtered PPG signal	
	
	MAP estimation using PH
	
	Fourier transform of PP intervals and estimation of HF and LF
	
	Implementation in Matlab with an interactive GUI
	
* Project2: Nervous Activity Analyzer

	Digital filtering of a raw EEG signal
	
	Extraction of alpha, beta, theta, delta waves from a filtered EEG signal
	
	Computation of STD, AVG and CC
	
	Implementation in Matlab with an interactive GUI
	
* Project3: Project 3: Muscle Activity Analyzer<br>
	Digital filtering of a raw EMG signal<br>	
	Computation of rectified EMG from a filtered EMG signal<br>	
	Computation of the spectrum of the filtered EMG signal using Fourier transform<br>	
	Computation of RMS, ARV<br>	
	Implementation in Matlab with an interactive GUI
